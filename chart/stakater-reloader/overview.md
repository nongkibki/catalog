## About Pushgateway

The Prometheus Pushgateway accepts metrics from ephemeral or batch jobs and exposes them for scraping by Prometheus. It
provides a simple HTTP API for pushing metrics and supports optional persistence to survive restarts.

Common use cases include short-lived job instrumentation, CI/CD job reporting, and batch-processing metric exposure that
cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus.

## About Docker Hardened Images

foundation for containerized workloads by incorporating security best practices from the start.

### Why use Docker Hardened Images?

These images are published with near-zero known CVEs, include signed provenance, and come with a complete Software Bill
of Materials (SBOM) and VEX metadata. They're designed to secure your software supply chain while fitting seamlessly
into existing Docker workflows.
