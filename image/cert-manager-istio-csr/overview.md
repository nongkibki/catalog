## About cert-manager-istio-csr

cert-manager-istio-csr is an agent that integrates cert-manager with Istio for certificate management in Kubernetes
clusters. It acts as a gRPC server that receives Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs) from the Istio control plane
(istiod) and uses cert-manager's CertificateRequest API to sign certificates. The agent also distributes CA bundles by
creating and updating `istio-ca-root-cert` ConfigMaps in all namespaces, ensuring Istio workloads can trust the
certificates issued by cert-manager.

cert-manager-istio-csr supports Istio v1.10+ and cert-manager v1.3+, providing a seamless integration between these two
popular Kubernetes projects. It exposes Prometheus metrics on port 9402 and provides health checks via a readiness probe
on port 6060, making it easy to monitor and integrate into existing Kubernetes deployments.
