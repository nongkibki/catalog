## About cert-manager-controller

cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the
process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

It supports issuing certificates from a variety of sources, including Let's Encrypt (ACME), HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi
TPP / TLS Protect Cloud, as well as local in-cluster issuance.

cert-manager also ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate
time before expiry to reduce the risk of outages and remove toil.

The cert-manager-controller automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates, simplifying the using of
certificates for applications running in a Kubernetes cluster.
